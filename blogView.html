        <h2>Why Programming is Hard</h2>
        <p>Learning how to program is not easy, especially when you don&apos;t know where to start from and where you want to go. The process to start learning         programming often starts with a google search and things become more complex as you are bombarded with suggestions from various websites and blogs shown up on your search results. Now the decision to choose one from an ocean of Languages and Technology stacks becomes more complex and confusing. Another reason for programming being hard is that the demand for the technologies and programming languages keeps changing over the time, so it is often very confusing to choose a particular language and bet your time and energy on learning it.</p>
        
        <p>Even after you find a tech-stack you want to follow, its not easy be persistent at learning programming and the process is often very tiring for beginners because programming needs time and consistency. But we all have a basic human nature that we often crave for quick results and hence loose motivation very quickly when no significant progress is in sight for a long period of time, but we need to develop a habit of being consistent at learning every day to become a professional programmer.</p>
        
        <p>To trim down this complexity, I will recommend that you should choose a language which is currently in demand in the Industry(means there are enough jobs in the field and demand is ever increasing). Second step is to find a suitable resource(course or tutorial) to learn the chosen language/technology. Choose a resource that provides you an opportunity to apply the knowledge you gained from the course like making projects.</p>   
        
        <p>Whenever you are stuck during the learning process, always reach out for help. you can search online by googling the error, coding forum websites(Stackoverflow) or you can ask for help from your peers/mentors. <strong>One thing you should remember always is that in programming, everything that&apos;s happening has a logic behind it, whether its a feature or a bug/error. So, if you get stuck you just have find the logic or reason behind that error.</strong> The reason could be anything: mistyping, programming language syntax, incorrect logic or anything else related to computing. You should not panic and patiently look for the things you&apos;ve done wrong that can be corrected. Being patient and un-anxious while debugging your code is the most prominent skill you&apos;ll require during your programming learning path as well as your programming career.</p>    
        
        <p>Another thing to remember is to set an achievable goals for yourself while learning programming. Don&apos;t try to learn everything at once otherwise you will get stuck in tutorial hell. Its not knowledge of every programming language that makes a good programmer, but rather possessing skills to know how and where you can apply the knowledge you possess. The more you learn, the more you know information what to possess and what to ignore.</p>    
    
        <p>Lastly, I would say that learning programming is not a task that you can complete but rather a process that needs to kept on repeating and it gets easy and better over time.</p>    
        <h3>Happy Learning, Happy Programming!</h3>
